## Microbiome Restructuring: Dominant Coral Bacterium _Endozoicomonas_ Species Respond Differentially to Environmental Changes

This repository contains the script used to analyze data and create figures for the manuscript "Microbiome Restructuring: Dominant Coral Bacterium _Endozoicomonas_ Species Respond Differentially to Environmental Changes" published in [mSystems](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00359-22)

All sequencing data generated in the manuscript was submitted under the BioProject no. [PRJNA758232](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA758232), and the “Ca. Endozoicomonas penghunesis” genome was made available under GenBank accession no. [SAMN21016876](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN21016876/).

*Importance of this study* The coral microbiome has been known to play a crucial role in host health. In recent years, we have known that the coral microbiome changes in response to external stressors and that coral hosts structure their microbiome in a host-specific manner. However, an important internal factor, the ability of microbiome members to respond to change, has been often neglected. In this study, we combine *_metabarcoding_*, *_culturing_*, and *_genomics_* to delineate the differential ability of two dominant _Endozoicomonas_ species, including a novel *“Ca. Endozoicomonas penghunesis”* 4G, to respond to change in the environment following a reciprocal transplant experiment.
